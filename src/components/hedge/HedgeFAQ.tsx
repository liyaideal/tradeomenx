    a: "No. A Trial Position Voucher is not cash and is not withdrawable. It's used to open a hedge position on OmenX. If that position closes in profit, you can redeem rewards under the campaign rules.",

    q: "What if my hedge loses?",
    a: "Losses on the trial position won't be deducted from your main account balance.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the 500U reward guaranteed?",
    a: "No. The max redeemable reward depends on your hedge position's performance, the entry price, and the campaign reward cap.",

    q: "Why connect my Polymarket wallet?",

      "Each Polymarket event can only receive one airdrop position reward.",
      "After a Polymarket account is successfully connected, the system will scan eligible positions every 15 minutes. Airdrop positions will only be issued after the scan confirms that all requirements are met. Please refer to the actual arrival time in your account.",

After settlement, positive profit, if any, will be credited to the user's trading account balance.",
          "Settlement amount rules: The total settlement profit from airdrop positions is subject to a per-account cap of 500U. Settlement rewards must meet the corresponding valid trading volume requirements before they can be unlocked in stages and used for trading or withdrawal.",
          "Valid trading volume: Only trading volume with an actual fee rate of 0.04% or higher will be counted. Trading volume below this threshold will not count toward the unlocking progress.",
          "The daily platform-wide limit for airdrop positions is 500 positions. Once the daily limit is reached, no additional airdrop positions will be issued that day.",
          "The total prize pool for this airdrop position campaign is 150,000U. Once the prize pool limit is reached, the campaign will end early, and any unsettled or locked reward amounts will no longer be available for continued use.",

      "If users have any dispute regarding campaign rewards, they must contact customer support via Discord within 7 days after the campaign ends: https://discord.com/invite/qXssm2crf9. Any claim submitted after this period will be deemed as a voluntary waiver of the relevant rights.",
