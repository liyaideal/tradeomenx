# OmenX Campaign Landing Design System

> Dedicated design specification for campaign landing pages and homepage campaign banners. Keep this separate from `DESIGN.md`, which remains the product UI system.

---

## 1. Purpose

Campaign landing pages are conversion microsites, not product screens. Their job is to move a user through one clear action with a confident visual narrative.

- **Primary use cases**: mainnet launch, trading competitions, referral campaigns, reward campaigns, seasonal activations.
- **Primary conversion**: one action per campaign, usually sign up, start trading, connect account, or claim reward.
- **Design tone**: premium exchange campaign, editorial finance, precise ledger language.
- **Do not imitate**: generic crypto launch pages, AI template pages, outsourced banner art, random card grids.

---

## 2. Separation from Product Design

`DESIGN.md` is for the core product: trading UI, wallet, portfolio, settings, transparency, data tables.

`CAMPAIGN_DESIGN.md` is for campaign surfaces only:

- `/mainnet-launch`
- `/hedge`
- future campaign landing pages
- homepage campaign carousel slides
- campaign-specific modals or final CTA blocks

Campaign pages may reuse brand tokens, auth flows, and product data, but they must not blindly reuse product page composition.

### Creative variation requirement

This document defines standards, not a single landing-page template. Every new campaign must choose a campaign archetype and create a distinct visual direction. Do not ship multiple campaigns that only swap copy and hero art while preserving the same page structure.

Acceptable reuse:

- safe width and overflow rules,
- vertical section headers,
- CTA hierarchy,
- reward clarity rules,
- QA checklist,
- reusable primitives.

Required variation:

- hero composition,
- visual metaphor,
- pacing and density,
- section order when the campaign story requires it,
- illustration/data-visual treatment,
- reward presentation style.

### Forbidden cross-contamination

- Do not use product desktop page title pattern with the purple left rail.
- Do not use `.trading-card`, `.stats-card`, or dense product cards as the main section language.
- Do not copy product list-page spacing into campaign sections.
- Do not add campaign-specific rules to the main `DESIGN.md` except for a short pointer to this document if needed.

## 3. Page Architecture

A campaign page should follow a clear narrative arc:

1. **Hero** — what this campaign is, why it matters, primary CTA.
2. **Proof / Trust** — concrete facts, not vague claims.
3. **Mechanism** — how the user qualifies.
4. **Reward Ledger** — reward amounts, status, tiers, payout timing.
5. **Rules** — constraints in plain language.
6. **FAQ** — technical details and edge cases.
7. **Final CTA** — one final conversion moment.

Each section must earn its place. If it does not help conversion or reduce confusion, remove it.

## 4. Layout Rules

### Safe width

- Desktop safe container: `max-w-7xl`.
- Desktop horizontal padding: `px-8`.
- Mobile horizontal padding: `px-5`.
- Every campaign page root must include `w-full max-w-full overflow-x-hidden`.
- Every full-width section must include `w-full max-w-full overflow-hidden`.
- All CSS grids must use `minmax(0, …)` when columns can shrink.

### Section spacing

- Desktop sections: `py-20`.
- Mobile sections: `py-12`.
- Hero desktop top/bottom may be larger, but must still reveal the next section on common desktop and mobile viewports.

### Section header rule

Campaign section headers are vertical:

```tsx
eyebrow
Title
Description
```

**Never place the title and description side by side in two columns** unless a specific signed-off editorial mockup requires it.

### Avoid card stacking

- Do not put cards inside cards.
- Do not make entire page sections floating cards.
- Use framed panels only for repeated items, ledgers, dashboards, and CTAs.

---

## 5. Typography

- Use `font-sans` for campaign headlines and explanations.
- Use `font-mono` only for amounts, dates, status tags, addresses, short tickers, and ledger values.
- Hero title: large, confident, short. Prefer the campaign name or literal offer.
- Section title: clear, editorial, not slogan-heavy.
- Body copy: direct and human. Avoid inflated marketing copy.

### Casing

- Eyebrows: uppercase mono, short only.
- Section titles: Title Case only when they are headings.
- Descriptions: sentence case.
- Data labels: short uppercase mono.

---

## 6. Visual Language

Campaign pages should have one coherent metaphor per campaign.

Examples:

- **Mainnet Launch**: launch console, ledger, settlement window, production switch.
- **Trading Competition**: scoreboard, bracket, rank table, arena lights.
- **Referral Campaign**: network graph, invite chain, payout tree.
- **Rewards Campaign**: vault, credit ledger, payout queue.

### Forbidden generic motifs

- Rocket illustrations.
- Emoji rewards or emoji section labels.
- Random purple-blue gradients.
- Floating glass cards without purpose.
- Glowing orb backgrounds.
- Fake 3D coins/gifts unless custom-directed.
- Stock-looking images unrelated to the actual campaign.
- Overdecorated banners with too many badges and CTAs.

---

## 7. Campaign Components

Use dedicated campaign-system components for new campaign pages:

- `CampaignPageShell`
- `CampaignSection`
- `CampaignSectionHeader`
- `CampaignMetricStrip`
- `CampaignLedgerPanel`
- `CampaignCTA`
- `CampaignBannerFrame`

Do not rebuild campaign section structure with ad hoc Tailwind each time.

---

## 8. Homepage Campaign Carousel

Homepage campaign slides are compact campaign entries, not separate ad posters.

### Banner structure

Homepage banners must be structured UI, not one baked image. Text, labels, metrics, countdowns, and CTAs must be rendered as DOM content so they remain editable, readable, accessible, and localizable.

Required slots:

1. **Message slot** — eyebrow/status labels, headline, and one short description.
2. **Action slot** — one primary CTA and optional countdown/status timestamp.
3. **Proof slot** — up to three compact metric chips; no paragraph-like lists.
4. **Visual slot** — right-side illustration, product crop, data graphic, or campaign-specific composition. The image may support the story, but must not contain core reward text or CTA copy.

Desktop composition:

- Use a left-message / right-visual split for the default banner pattern.
- Message slot should occupy roughly `55–65%`; visual slot should occupy roughly `35–45%`.
- Keep the whole slide inside the homepage safe container (`max-w-7xl`, matching page padding).
- Recommended desktop height: `220–260px`.
- Never let decorative visuals define the banner width; all visuals must be clipped by the banner frame.

Mobile composition:

- Stack message first, then a compact visual/proof treatment if space allows.
- Recommended mobile height: `170–220px`.
- CTA must remain visible without depending on hover.

### Banner configuration

Banner copy must be configurable per slide:

```ts
type CampaignBannerConfig = {
  id: string;
  archetype: "split-feature" | "scoreboard" | "referral-network" | "reward-vault" | "editorial";
  href: string;
  eyebrow: string;
  labels: Array<{ text: string; tone: "accent" | "success" | "neutral" }>;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  ctaLabel: string;
  metrics?: Array<{ label: string; value: string }>;
  countdown?: boolean;
  visual: { kind: "image" | "component"; asset?: string; alt?: string };
};
```

### Carousel behavior

- Maximum three active slides.
- Auto-rotate every `6–8s`.
- Pause auto-rotation on hover/focus.
- Use manual pagination dots — follow the product-level **Pagination Dots** spec in `DESIGN.md` §5 (active `bg-primary`, never re-themed per campaign). Pagination is product chrome, not campaign content.
- The slide must use the same visual language as its landing page, but future campaigns must vary archetype and composition so the carousel does not become a repeated template.
- It must not create horizontal overflow at `1024px`, `1280px`, `1366px`, or mobile widths.
- One primary CTA only.

---

## 9. Reward and Rules Presentation

Reward modules must feel like payout ledgers, not coupon cards.

Required clarity:

- Qualification threshold.
- Whether rewards are guaranteed or probabilistic.
- Whether tiers are cumulative.
- Volume formula if relevant.
- Payout timing.
- Exclusions such as wash trading.

Keep technical formulas out of the hero. Put formulas in FAQ or rules.

---

## 10. Responsive QA Checklist

Before shipping any campaign page, check:

- `1024 × 768`: no horizontal scrollbar; header and page safe area align.
- `1280 × 720`: hero fits and next section is hinted.
- `1366 × 768`: section rhythm does not feel sparse.
- `390 × 844`: headline wraps cleanly; CTA is reachable.
- `320 × 568`: no clipped CTA text or overlapping badges.
- Homepage carousel: both first and second slides fit at desktop and mobile.

---

## 11. Quality Bar

A campaign page is not acceptable if it looks like:

- a generic AI landing page,
- a crypto template,
- an outsourced one-off banner,
- a product settings page with larger text,
- or a collection of unrelated cards.

It is acceptable only when it has a clear campaign concept, restrained hierarchy, strong typography, and reusable campaign-system structure.
